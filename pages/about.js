            <h2>About Me</h2>
            I have honed my technical skills in a variety of programming languages and frameworks,
            including Next.js, React, Javascript Python, and Java. I have a deep love for learning
            and love taking on new challenges that will expand my skillset. I'm particularly motivated
            by projects that will have a positive impact on people.
            <br /><br />
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me photographing birds. I've seen over 850
            species worldwide, and don't plan on slowing down any time soon!
