## About

For the final project for the course, we were able to design a site that responded
to a theme of the course of our choosing. I decided to take on the topic of data
privacy and ["filter bubbles"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble).
There are no users, and no real "posts" on the application: just the same ~700
photos of five breeds of dogs. Using a pretty basic algorithm, the breeds the
user "likes" begin to appear more and more often over time. After a minute, a
pop up appears, showing the user exact statistics on both what breeds of dogs
they liked, and how the algorithm was tailoring their experience.

## What I've Learned

I wanted to challenge myself to learn Next.js with this application, and was
able to do so successfully. This was also the first time I implemented an
infinite scroll, designed to mimic that of popular social media companies.
I integrated what I learned about design from the course into the application,
and believe I was able to create an experience that adequately responded to the
data privacy and filter bubbles themes of the course.

## Technologies Used
