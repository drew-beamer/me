[DavidsonDecoded](https://twitter.com/DavidsonDecoded) is a project I developed
to provide data-driven insights and analysis to fans of Davidson College's 
athletics teams.

## About
In February 2021, a friend of mine pointed out a lack of Twitter accounts covering
Davidson's athletics teams through an analytical lens. Inspired by 
[@SBUnfurled](https://twitter.com/SBUnfurled) and other similar accounts, I set out
to add some data analysis to fans of Davidson Men's Basketball. Since then, I've
worked on providing insights about Davidson Volleyball as well.

## What I've Learned
Researching and doing data analysis allowed me to learn *a lot* about advanced 
basketball analytics. I have also learned quite a bit about predictive modeling,
and have developed models to predict the outcomes of both tournaments and 
seasons. Data visualization and communication has also been an important
component, and I believe my visualizations have become easier to understand over 
time.

## Examples
- [Simulating the A10 Tournament](https://twitter.com/DavidsonDecoded/status/1366922886561210369?s=20)
- [Predicting A10 Regular Season Records](https://twitter.com/DavidsonDecoded/status/1412136851868045313?s=20)

## Technologies Used
- Python, including Jupyter Notebooks
- Excel
- Tableau Public
- Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop

## Recognition
The Twitter has gained a following consisting of Davidson (and general college sports) fans, coaches, and 
players.
