## About

I try to showcase the beauty and diversity of the avian world. I've taken photos
in a variety of locations, ranging from my local patches in Charlotte and San Diego
to incredible birding destinations such as Costa Rica and Belize. I always love
seeing new birds and being able to share photos with my followers.

## What I've Learned

I've come a long way as a photographer since starting the account, and scrolling
back in the feed reflects that. I've also been able to learn a little bit about
social media marketing along the way.

## Recognition & Accomplishments

- Have gained 1500 followers since starting
- Some of my photos have been featured on various prominent accounts, such as
  [eBird](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1mexbRgakK/), and
  [The Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cdix3GhMYer/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).
- In 2019, I was awarded a scholarship to attend the NANPA High School
  Scholarship program in the Smoky Mountains.
