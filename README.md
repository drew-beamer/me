# Welcome to Drew Beamer's Personal Site

This is a personal blog built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). It is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=next-website).

It is a spinoff of the Next.js tutorial site, which can be found here: <https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app>

## Inspiration

It took a long time to get the site to a state I'm proud of, and I'd like to give credits to sites I was inspired by in the process

## Getting Started/Running the Repository Locally

3. Start the Development Server

## About the Blog Posts

Blog Posts are written using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), a format where JSX can be incorporated into Markdown files. I believe this is the easiest way to work with `next/Image` within the blog posts, and improves loading time for images substantially. Posts are stored in the `posts` directory, and corresponding images can be found in the `public/images/posts/[name of post]` directory.
